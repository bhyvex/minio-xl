///  User-Agent:
///
///      This is ignored from signing because signing this causes problems with generating pre-signed URLs
///      (that are executed by other agents) or when customers pass requests through proxies, which may
///      modify the user-agent.
///
///  Content-Length:
///
///      This is ignored from signing because generating a pre-signed URL should not provide a content-length
///      constraint, specifically when vending a S3 pre-signed PUT URL. The corollary to this is that when
///      sending regular requests (non-pre-signed), the signature contains a checksum of the body, which
///      implicitly validates the payload length (since changing the number of bytes would change the checksum)
///      and therefore this header is not valuable in the signature.
///
///  Content-Type:
///
///      Signing this header causes quite a number of problems in browser environments, where browsers
///      like to modify and normalize the content-type header in different ways. There is more information
///      on this in https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js/issues/244. Avoiding this field simplifies logic
///      and reduces the possibility of future bugs
///
///  Authorization:

///      Is skipped for obvious reasons
